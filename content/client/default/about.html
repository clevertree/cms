        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            It's all about the homeless. From local to nationwide and elsewhere, our focus is on homelessness issues and coming up with solutions with the local community.
            <br>
            Arizona Friends of Homeless is a non-profit 501c3 organization which serves the homeless through daily outreach, connections to local services, shelters, and programs. AFOH's focus is to provide awareness to the public on homelessness issues in Arizona and allow locals a forum to voice their concerns and ideas. We also perform daily and weekly outreach services and distribute items like food, clothing, blankets, towels, hygiene packs, ponchos, tarp, flashlights, socks, back packs, bikes, shoes, pet food and more relief to the homeless at various locations within Phoenix. In addition, AFOH teams up and looks for opportunities to partner with homelessness advocacy groups, organizations, and individuals within the community. AFOH is involved in many projects and collaborations to help fight homelessness in Arizona.
